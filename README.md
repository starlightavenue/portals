# Magically Fix Insurance Claims
## Scope
This project will let users toggle back and forth between various interfaces:

- A Patient Health Insurance Portal
- A Medical Provider Message Portal
- An Insurace Agent Message Portal

The aim is to solve issues with medical insurance claims and prevent the patient from losing their mind over stress.

### Why?
I had a very frustrating experience being bounced back and forth between insurance, and various healthcare departments for over a month trying to get a prior authorization sent over after it had been forgotten in the December holiday rush. 

It was incredibly stressful, and at the time of this repo's creation, it still hasn't been resolved. I've heard so much conflicting information from various parties. I've witnessed people snip and snark at other departments and companies for not knowing how to do their jobs. Billing departments have hung up on three-way calls once insurance agents introduce themselves. Staff give incorrect answers on what to do next with full confidence instead of checking with colleagues, and then someone else thinks it's cool to chew me out over the phone for trusting the information I was given.

It's exhausting.

I have no idea how any of this actually works in reality because I do not work in healthcare or insurance, but this repo is a make-believe world where fixing issues with claims really is that easy.

### So what is this?
Being so incredibly honest right now, I don't know.

I'm just a patient who is frustrated with the situation they've stumbled into who wants to dream of a reality where all it takes is a few clicks to fix things.

I genuinely have no idea how this will end up because I'm still going through my coding bootcamp, and as one might assume, I'm dealing with some health stuff. But I want to add to this project as I learn more about web development. Maybe a patient satisfaction bar as you work through claims?

I'm sure if people who worked in healthcare and insurance saw this, they would tell me how inaccurate it is, but that's okay with me! I'm just trying to turn a stressful situation into something lighter :yellow_heart:
